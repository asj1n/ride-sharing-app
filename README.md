# Ride Sharing Application

- Development of the domain model layer of RideSharingApp (RSA), a ride-sharing platform matching drivers and passengers based on proximity and shared destination. Business logic implemented using design patterns and Test-Driven-Development (TDD), validated with JUnit and additional custom tests; persistence via serialization, prepared for future JPA integration
- Backend implemented in Java Spring Boot, using Quadtrees to optimize location-based matching. Web interface built with Vaadin, structured into classes with side tabs, enabling user and vehicle management, ride creation and updates, reviews, and dynamic ride matching based on user locations
